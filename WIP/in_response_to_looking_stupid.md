# in response to looking stupid.

I hate looking stupid. Or at least, I hate looking stupid when I want to seem smart.
There's tons of times where I purposely make a fool of myself or play
the fool because it lightens the mood, makes others more comfortable, and diverts attention
from a potentially embarassing moment for someone else. In those moments, I'd like to believe
that empathetically, I'm helping others, and selfishly, I'm bringing attention to myself, but
when it comes to most areas of my life, I do everything in my power to avoid being seen as
unintelligent.

In particular, I've never been good with feeling stupid in front of strangers. There's something
to be said about how initial interactions create this immense amount of pressure to perform. Part of it
is the idea that first impressions can feel permanent. Whitney Johnson, CEO of Disruption
Advisors, says that

> “We make judgments [about other people] in a nanosecond.” And once that impression is formed, it’s “very, _very_ hard to change it.”
