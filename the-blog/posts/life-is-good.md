title: My name is Ezeugo?

Shortly after the end of my senior year of college, I wanted to be called Ezeugo. And for someone
who spent 22 years prior being called John, I realize even 3 years later, that it was more jarring
than I could imagine. When I took some time to reflect on where the desire came from I remembered a
moment during my freshmen year when in an attempt to rebrand,[^1] I told my professor that my
nickname was Kwame. Now in hindsight, there was no real value to doing so, and the effects of that
decision didn't leave that classroom, but at a fundamental level, my desire to make my African-ness
more prominent and obvious had been the case for a while.

Fast forward 4 years later, and removed from the shackles of a collegiate community I was no longer
bound to, I had the chance to identify in the way that had always been most comfortable for me. The
change though, wasn't nearly as clean cut as I imagined it might be, and no where near as easy as it
should have been. I had people who had been friends with me for years unwilling to change how they
identified me. Others, more considerate, still struggled to recognize and appreciate it, but the
most shocking was that very few people cared to ask why.

I had spent most of my life living as a Nigerian-American who for the most part, lived in "America"
in certain contexts and "Little Owerri"[^2] in others. When my parents would interact with my
friends, they would make it a point to call me "John", a name my father had given me to pass down
the patriarchal legacy that is so deeply entrenched in Nigerian culture. My friends, specifically
the non Nigerians who found themselves in a Nigerian context, never felt the need to conform. For
me, the mismatch was clear. As long as my Nigerian-ness was the bubble inside of a larger American
conversation, the two would never be equal.

[^1]:
    This was for a class called Frontiers of Science my freshmen year. So again, absolutely no
    rhyme or reason.

[^2]:
    I'm pretty sure almost no one uses this to refer to the pocket of Igbo immigrants in
    Baltimore, but that's who I'm referring to when I say this. Also should clarify that there's
    nothing little about the people who are a part of this community.
