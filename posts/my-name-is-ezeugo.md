Names are a really interesting concept. In some ways, they're meant to be this unique identifier
that helps add authenticity to your identity. In other ways, they're a cultural mechanism that
binds you to the commonality of those whose name you share. For me, my name, John Ezeugo Anukem,
has always felt like this awkward smothering of ideas that dont quite fit together. John, the name
of the baptist, the name of over 12 million people in the US alone, the name of my father. Ezeugo,
the name that means "King of the Eagle", the name, at least to my knowledge, created by my
father, and shared by none.[^1] And lastly, Anukem, the name that means "When I speak, people
listen", the name that connects me to grandfather's home in the village, and the name that connects
me to my superstar tik tok cousins in Virginia.

Shortly after the end of my senior year of college, I wanted to be called Ezeugo. And for someone
who spent 22 years prior being called John, I realize even 3 years later, that it was more jarring
than I could imagine. When I took some time to reflect on where the desire came from, I thought a lot
about the idea that I wanted to have continuity and consistency in all parts of my life. It struck me
as odd, that going out into the world I was "John", the jokester, the nerd, the guy who loved to make
fun of himself. And yet, at home, and in close social communities like church, I was "Ezeugo",
the comedian, the know it all, and the guy who wasn't afraid to embarass himself for the sake of
someone else's laughter. To have to code switch at whatever level, felt inauthentic to who I was in every
space. The next natural conclusion of that thought was obvious. Was I "John" in both spaces, or was I "Ezeugo".

When I thought about how I'd answer that question, I remembered a moment during my freshmen year
when in an attempt to rebrand, I told my professor that my nickname was Kwame, a traditionally Ghanaian name.
Now in hindsight, there was no real value to doing so, and the effects of that decision didn't leave that classroom,
but at a fundamental level, my desire to make my African-ness more prominent and obvious had been
the case for a while. I wanted to be Nigerian-American, not an American who happens to be from Nigeria.

I had spent most of my life living as a Nigerian-American but I lived in America
under a Nigerian context. When my parents would interact with my friends, they would make it a point
to call me "John", On the other hand, my friends, specifically the non Nigerians who found themselves
in that Nigerian context, never felt the need to conform. For me, the mismatch was clear. As long as my
Nigerian-ness was the sidenote inside of a larger American conversation, the two would never be equal.

From there, the answer was obvious. I was and will continue to be Ezeugo in every context. Not just because
it represents what I believe are the best parts of who I am, but also as an act of resistance against what
would otherwise be the norm in my life. Every call and response is a reaffirmation of the notion that who
I am and what I'm about is rooted in a culture of strength, and honor that inform every action I take.

[^1]: I recently found that there's a couple other people with the name Ezeugo (or at least what they claim on Clubhouse).
