# On failure.

For some odd reason, I'm obsessed with the idea of failure. I think a lot about how folks in my industry talk about
it as some catalyst for change when in actuality, it renders most people immobile. I'm certainly guilty of it.
So what makes failure stick? My guess is a consistent, and intentional reflection of how and why failure happens.
Instead of trying to avoid failure at all costs, it seems more prudent to develop the meta skill of identifying when
something _looks_ like it might be a failure of the past.

To that end, I'll use this space to document some of my most notable failures, with the hope that as the list grows,
so too does my ability to pattern match and and ultimately avoid them.

1. Not negotiating my first offer out of college.

   I chalk this one up to being new to the game, but in a lot of ways, I stopped betting on myself and took the first
   opportunity I was given that sounded like something I would want. I'll never forget the day I got the call sitting in
   my dorm room that MSFT was interested in extending me an offer. I was overjoyed not just because I had made it
   through what I thought was a rigorous interview process, but I also managed to capture the acclaim that comes with
   a name like Microsoft which mattered not just myself, but also because it meant I could explain what I do in a way my
   Nigerian parents could digest.

   Maybe in another post, I'll talk about why I think status is one of the biggest traps humans fall into, but for now, I'll
   stick to processing how it played me here.

   This meant that when they gave me the numbers for my total compensation, the only other reference point I had
   was from the mid sized start up I had worked for extending me a return offer, which ultimately, didn't compare.
   Additionally, the idea that I might ask for more, when it was more than I or anyone in my family had seen at that point,
   seemed not only selfish, but ungrateful.

   From this I learned a couple things.

   1. The way we _frame_ decisions has a much greater impact on whether or not we arrive at the _right_ conclusions than
      our information gaps.
      So much of what we think we don't know becomes clear the moment we know what the right set of questions to ask is.
   2. When making a life changing decision, like where you choose to work, status, and generally what other people will think, should be weighted very low
      on the list of things that will help you decide.

2. This blog post.

   I was going through old thoughts in a personal repo and found this almost exactly a year from the date I had initially written it. Even after finally
   managing to release my personal website, I still never gathered up enough sense to make this post real. It's a great example of the kind of thing I do often
   where my excitement in a moment will lead me to start some new passion project, but when the demands of life kick back in, its the first thing I drop on the floor.
   In part, I think its because things like this post are extremely personal, and a lot of what I try to do is for other people. So leaving this in the graveyard of
   coulda/shoulda/woulda often helps me focus more intently on helping other people. But the truth of the matter is, I don't prioritize myself, or the things I want often
   enough, and it just as easily leads to me feeling like I can't do the things that make me and only me happy.
